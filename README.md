# Just-Dazai-help-wanted-
anyone can help me create something similar to Monika After Story, but Dazai? and with Ollama? AI already gave me a bit of things...

although, I should tell you what I want if you are going to help me in this...Ahem, here:

I was just planing on creating something like Monika After Story (but instead, Dazai After Story), so you know what it means and sometimes, Ollama generates random conversation Dazai starts with player and (like the actual MAS) player can ask quesntions of Dazai too (wich Ollama generates Dazai responses for thos questions) and sometimes, Ollama even adds questions to specified categories that player can ask but...anytime Dazai asks a question from player while saying his random conversation, input box will appear.

rules: never roleplay as each other, just stick to your own character, input boxs must NOT appear when Dazai isn't asking a question from player

extras: player can use tags for defining action like;
CTRL + i (will activate italics, that is used for actions)
CTRL + b (will activate bold, that is used when player is talking loudly)
